<h3> University Experience </h3>
  <p>Being someone who has now experienced both in person and remote university learning. I find myself in a possition where I can compare and highlight the downfalls and the successes of each method of learning. 've been wondering if a BA degree is really worth it. I woudl like to believe that my critical thinking, writing and complex reasoning skills would have improved throughout the course of my BA degree. We can't ignor the fact that remot learning has vastly changed the "college experience". </p>

<h3> Adult  litteracy </h3>
  <p>I was on a zoom meeting when someone called me illiterate. I suspect that this was meant as an inslut. I suspect I was called illiterate because I had a different acent while reading a preamble. I however don't take it as an insult. The word illiterate is often thrown around as an insult muddling classism, racism and sexism. I was in primary school when I met an adult who could not read funny enough he was a really skilled builder who was doing some upgrades on our house. The reason "Illiterate" can be used as an isult is because the cause of illiteracy is confused as lazyness instead of structural inequality (poverty). </p>

<h3>What is research?</h3>
  <p>
    Questioning what one authority or one's self thinks to be true and then finding or creating a study/experiment to measure results in numbers (quantitative) or words, pictures, or even artifacts (qualitative) or mixed methods (both quantitative and qualitative). <br>

<h3>Can I get an ameen?</h3>

   Ladson-Billings (2000) takes an even stronger stance than Schwandt in asserting that the  choice  of  a  paradigm  (and  its  associated  epistemology  or  systems  of  knowing)  rep-resents a choice between hegemony and liberation. She recommends that the academy go beyond transformation to reconstruction, meaning that teaching, service, research, and scholarship  would  be  equally  valued  and  used  in  the  service  of  furthering  intellectual  enrichment,  social  justice,  social  betterment,  and  equity  (Ladson-Billings  &  Donnor,  2005, p. 295). <br>
